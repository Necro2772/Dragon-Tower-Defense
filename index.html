            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>When you press Play, enemies will begin spawning from the purple tile and progress along the path towards the green tile. Each enemy that reaches the green tile takes one life, and your goal is to defeat the enemies before they reach this.</p>
            <p>You can select a type of dragon and place them somewhere outside the path if you have enough treasure, and they will attack any enemies that enter their range. Acquire more treasure by defeating enemies. Dragons can be upgraded or sold by selecting them and then selecting an upgrade or pressing the sell button.</p>
            <h2>Controls</h2>
            <p>Place Tower - Select a tower from the list, then click where you want to place it</p>
            <p>Edit Tower - Select a placed tower to see the upgrade and sell options</p>
            <p>Play / Change Speed / Restart - Press the Play button to start a level. The same button will change the speed of the game during a level, or if you run out of lives it will restart the game.</p>
